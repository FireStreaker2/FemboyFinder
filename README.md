## Info
> A simple image querier using express and danbooru.

This project was originally a way to find, as implied by the title, femboys. However, I also realized that since it queries by a tag name, it works for all things. Ex. you can search for not just femboys, but also other anime/manga characters.

## Usage
> <mark>PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE IMAGES YOU GET MIGHT POTENTIALLY BE NSFW. BY USING THIS PROJECT, YOU ARE SAYING YOU ARE 18+. MOREOVER, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS</mark>

You can get started by going to https://femboyfinder.firestreaker2.gq/query, where ``query`` is your input.   

Ex. https://femboyfinder.firestreaker2.gq/astolfo. 

> Note: because of the way that this project was coded, you can also send links inside of discord to have that image in an embed.
